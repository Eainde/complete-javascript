## Primitive Javscript Data Types
- Number : Floating point numbers, for decimals and integers
- String : Sequence of characters, used for text
- Boolean : Logical dtat type that can only be true and false
- Undefined : Data type for variable that does not have a value yet
- Null : Also means 'non-existent'
#### Javascript has dynamic typing: data types are automatically assigned to variables
